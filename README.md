# placepuppies

#This is a test project is to build an image placeholder like https://placeholder.com. 

#Users should be able to visit a url like https://via.placeholder.com/650x750 which will create a placeholder depending on the height and width. 

#This will be useful especially for developers who just want to keep a placeholder why developing UIs. 

#In this case, the placeholder should contain image of puppies, but the width and height should always be applied each time the route is hit and return random image

#Requirements

#The app should be version controlled.

#Have a route that looks similar to https://placepuppies.com/{width}/{height}

#The route should show random images all the time.

#You can use a database if there is a need for it.

#Use a cache to optimize the app such that an already fetched image with specific image and height is not re-fetched.

#Deploy the app

#Write unit tests.
